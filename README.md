This is the client front end for the ArchiCollector App, challenge of Codeable to Vinco
by David Montoya

## Usage
1. If you want to run it locally
  - Download ArchiCollector API repo: https://github.com/DavidMontoya24/archicollector_api
  - Go to src/config.js file and use that BASE_URI
  - On that directory run `npm start` to start the server on 8000 port
2. This repo is using by default the Heroku deployed API as BASE_URI
3. In both cases open this repo open your terminal and run `npm start` which takes 3000 port by default to run the app
